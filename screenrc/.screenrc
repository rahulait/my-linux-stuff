# Anything I don't describe is treated literally.
#
# %? - Start of a conditional statement.
# %F - Use this part of the statement if the window has focus (i.e. it
# is the only window or the currently active one).
# %{-b bc} - Turn off bold, blue foreground, cyan background.
# %: - else
# %{-b bb} - Turn off bold, blue foreground, blue background (this obscures
# the text on non-focused windows and just gives a blue line).
# %? - End conditional statement.
# %C - time (hh:mm, leading space) in 12 hour format
# %D - Three-letter day-of-week appreviation
# %M - Three-letter month appreviation
# %d - Day of the month
# %H - hostname
# %? - Start of conditional statement.
# %F - Use this part of the statement if the window has focus.
# %{+u wb} - underlined, white foreground, blue background
# %? - End conditional (if not focused, text remaind blue on blue).
# %L= - truncation/padding point. With the 'L' qualifier, basically
# just acts as a reference point. Further truncation/padding is
# done relative to here, not the beginning of the string
# %-Lw - window list up to but not including the current window (-),
# show window flags (L)
# %45> - truncation/padding marker; place this point about 45% of the
# way into the display area (45)
# %{+b by} - add bold (still underlined from before), blue foreground,
# yellow background
# %n - number of the current window
# %f - flags for current window
# %t - title of current window
# %{-} - undo last color change (so now we're back to underlined white
# on blue) (technically, this is a pop; a second invocation
# would drop things back to unadorned blue on cyan)
# %+Lw - window list from the next window on (-), show window flags (L)
# %-0< - truncation/padding point. Place this point zero spaces (0)
# from the right margin (-).
